    strategy_1_desc: We shot the entire 3 day event using 2 state of the art cameras. Not only did we provide a lot of photos for SWIFF to post after the event but we show video of the entire event as well.
    strategy_2_title: Social Media
    strategy_2_desc: We handled the social media before and during the event which includes a daily post showcasing the movies that were going to be shown as well as showcasing other sponsors of the event. We also built a bot to organically search for people that would be interested in the event.

    strategy_3_desc: We knew that people are always more engaged in a post online if they know they have the change of winning something. That's why we put together a giveaway of 2 VIP passes that receieved over 50K impressions online.

    testimonial: If advertisers spent the same amount of money on improving their products as they do on advertising then they wouldn't have to advertise them.
