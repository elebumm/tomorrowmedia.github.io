brief_title: Getting our hands dirty with one of the biggest fundraiser in town.
brief_description: Every year, Assante Wealth Management runs an annual event to raise money for Sarnia Rebound. It involves running through obstacles, getting dirty and colourful. For the last 2 years, we partnered with them to create a clean and crisp video for a dirty and messy event.

strategy_1_title: Photo / Video
strategy_1_desc: You need the correct tools for the job. In this case, 1 camera wasn't going to be enough to fill an entire park wide event with people running around in mud. We decided to use stabilizers for steady shots, mounted cameras for POV's and drones to capture everything from above.
strategy_2_title: Social Media
strategy_2_desc: With an event this popular and fun, we knew that in order to get the most out of this event we had to plan the video to be easily shareable. We made the cuts quick and sharp and made it the perfect length to give people hype for next year event. It was a huge success.

testimonial: If advertisers spent the same amount of money on improving their products as they do on advertising then they wouldn't have to advertise them.

conclusion_1: Rebound and Assante had their biggest year yet having thousands of people doing the run. We were able to capture everything on foot and in the air. We created a beautiful video that showcased everything that the event had to offer.
conclusion_2: They were so happy with the video that they asked us to participate and shoot the next Dirty Dash video.
