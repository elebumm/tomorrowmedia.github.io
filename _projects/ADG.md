strategy_2_desc: In order for this to be successful, we needed lots of people to view this video and submit an amazing dad. We created the short in order for moms and families to submit an amazing dad and to share it amongst their friends and family. Because of this, we received over 200 submissions.

testimonial: If advertisers spent the same amount of money on improving their products as they do on advertising then they wouldn't have to advertise them.

conclusion_1: The Amazing Dad Giveaway was by far one of the biggest giveaways and promotions to happen in the Sarnia-Lambton area. Both the videos combined have created over 60,000 impressions that will all come down to advertising for every party involved.
conclusion_2: Although it was hard, we completed the original goal as to what the Amazing Dad Giveaway was all about. Finding and celebrating amazing dads in the area. We are happy that this will be an annual giveaway to happen on every Fathers Day.
