brief_title: Helping one of the business community's strongest asset to the 21st century.
brief_description: We collaborated with the Sarnia Lambton Chamber of Commerce to bring their website up to date. Instead, we completely changed up their workflow internally. We set them up with modern day business tools to let them do their jobs more efficiently as well as set them up with a website that handles hundreds of business owners daily.

strategy_1_title: Web Design / Development
strategy_1_desc: We knew that the only way we can prove that the Chamber is the leader of business is by having a website made custom made for them. We designed the entire website from the ground up using modern day technologies and design principles.
strategy_2_title: Photo / Video
strategy_2_desc: Great web design helps show beautiful content. We provided beautiful shots of the chamber inside the building as well as the community it helps. Using state of the art equipment, we took beautiful shots on foot and in the air.
strategy_3_title: Strategy
strategy_3_desc: The Chamber never wanted to be that business that's always stuck in their old ways. Not only did we provide them with a brand new website, we also changed the way they do their emailing, sales and internal communications.

testimonial: If advertisers spent the same amount of money on improving their products as they do on advertising then they wouldn't have to advertise them.

conclusion_1: Working with the Chamber was a humbling experience. We were honored to have collaborated with the business leaders of Sarnia-Lambton and provided equal exchange of value.
conclusion_2: Today, https://slchamber.ca is one of the largest websites in the Sarnia-Lambton area, getting over 200-300 views daily while holding a big database of posts, media and data. All while providing value to members as well as reducing costs on their behalf.
